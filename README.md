# Image compression tool

Clustering is one of the most widely used techniques for an unsupervised learning problem. One application of clustering is in image compression.
In a 24-bit colour image, each pixel is of size 3 bytes with each colour intensity value between 0 to 255 and has in total 256^3 = 16 777 216 colours. As human eye doesnâ€™t distinguish so many colours at once, we can use k-means clustering to reduce the colour count. The aim is to lower the quality at a reasonable level, in order to reduce its file size and therefore, the cost of transmission.

A user has an option to compress an image or plot an original with multiple compressed images into one.
